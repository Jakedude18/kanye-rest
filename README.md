# kanye-rest
Repository for the code of a website that fetches tweets from kanye-rest API

   This website has 3 tabs. The unordered tab displays 10 random Kayne Rest tweets.
The ordered displays the same 10 tweets ordered by length. In both of these tabs you
can click on a tweet to 'like' it. This will replace the tweet with a new tweet and add 
the old tweet to the liked tweets tab. The liked tweets tab displays all the tweets a user has liked.

*Please note that liking tweets in the ordered tab can be confusing.
This is because the new tweet is automatically ordered.

*Also, this website runs best on a computer that is running chrome. Other browsers or devices may not work 
well for this website
